TaleCraft Launcher

===

This application only exists for the purpose of starting Minecraft,
but with the Mods 'Forge' and 'TaleCraft' bootstrapped to it,
and thus solving many problems that occur with the official Minecraft-Launcher.


This Application uses the following libraries:
- Mojang, authlib, 1.3
- Apache, commans lang, 3
- Apache, commons io, 2.4
- Google, gson, 2.2.2
- Google, guava, 15.0


This application is NOT officially supported by Mojang in any way!
This application is open-source but you are only allowed to contribute to it, not use it for your own stuff!
This application is solely made for the TaleCraft-Project!
